# Piotr Bara≈Ñski visiting card website

This is my visiting card, where I will include some information about me and my journey to the magical front-end world.  

It was created as a part of a homework given by *infoShare Academy's* trainer.

On this website you will find an information about how strong I feel in particular technologies/frameworks, projects I have finished and contact details,
